`FDTake` helps you quickly have the user take or choose an existing photo or video.

Usage
----------------
To use it, add an `FDTake` to your view and call

    - (void)takePhotoOrChooseFromLibrary

then implement `FDTakeDelegate` to receive the photo with

    - (void)takeController:(FDTakeController *)controller 
                  gotPhoto:(UIImage *)photo 
                  withInfo:(NSDictionary *)info`

Other available options are documented at <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/FDTake/0.2.1/">CocoaDocs for FDTake</a>.

How it works
----------------
 1. See if device has camera
 2. Create action sheet with appropriate options ("Take Photo" or "Choose from Library"), as available
 3. Localize "Take Photo" and "Choose from Library" into user's language
 4. Wait for response
 5. Bring up image picker with selected image picking method
 6. Default to selfie mode if so configured
 7. Get response, extract image from a dictionary
 8. Dismiss picker, send image to delegate
